# artificial-intelligence-coursework
- class projects for the UCLA course "Artificial Intelligence".
- [homework_1](https://github.com/jpicchi18/artificial-intelligence-coursework/tree/main/homework_1): Lisp operations on numeric sequences and trees
  - padovan number generator
  - efficiency anaylzer for padovan number generator
  - tree anonymizer
- [homework_2](https://github.com/jpicchi18/artificial-intelligence-coursework/tree/main/homework_2): river traveler problem solver
  - performs depth-limited search of a solution space and returns the optimal solution
- [homework_3](https://github.com/jpicchi18/artificial-intelligence-coursework/tree/main/homework_3): Sokoban puzzle solver
  - generates game states in a depth-first fashion until it finds a solution to the puzzle
  - uses A* search with sokoban-specific heuristics to improve search efficiency
- [homework_4](https://github.com/jpicchi18/artificial-intelligence-coursework/tree/main/homework_4): graph coloring to SAT problem converter
  - converts a graph coloring problem into an equivalent SAT problem
  - SAT problem is formatted to be inputted into a [SAT solver](http://reasoning.cs.ucla.edu/rsat/)
- [homework_5](https://github.com/jpicchi18/artificial-intelligence-coursework/tree/main/homework_5): Propositional Logic Exercises
  - analyzing validity, unsatisfiability, and tautologies
  - propositional logic knowledge bases, conjunctive normal form, and the resolution rule
  - bayesian inference
- [homework_6](https://github.com/jpicchi18/artificial-intelligence-coursework/tree/main/homework_6): Bayesian inference exercises
  - bayesian networks & the chain rule for bayesian networks
  - conditional probabilities, markovian asumptions (topological semantics), markov blankets
