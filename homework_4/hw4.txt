The SAT instance derived from 3-coloring of graph 1 is UNSATISFIABLE.

The SAT instance derived from 4-coloring of graph 1 is SATISFIABLE.

The above 2 SAT instances tell us that graph 1 can be 4-colored, but it cannot be
3-colored. In other words, there are too many constraints between the variables to
assign 1 of 3 colors to every variable in such a way that no 2 adjacent variables
have the same color, but we are able to accomplish the task of assigning 1 of 4 colors
to every node in such a way that no 2 adjacent nodes have the same color.

Can you give a solution (a coloring) to the graph coloring problem of the above graph
based on the results of RSat?

      Running RSAT on the SAT instance corresponding to 4-coloring graph 1 gives this
      line:
	v -1 -2 -3 4 -5 -6 7 -8 -9 10 -11 -12 -13 -14 15 -16 17 -18 -19 -20 -21
	  22 -23 -24 25 -26 -27 -28 0

      The affirmative propositional variable corresponding to each variable is given
      by:
		variable --> affirmative propositional variable
		       1 --> 4
		       2 --> 7
		       3 --> 10
		       4 --> 15
		       5 --> 17
		       6 --> 22
		       7 --> 25

       We convert each affirmative propositional variable index into the corresponding
       variable colorings using the equation:
       		coloring = prop_var_index - (var_index - 1) * k

       Apply the above equation to the results in the table above gives the following
       coloring solution:

       		variable --> color
		       1 --> 4
		       2 --> 3
		       3 --> 2
		       4 --> 3
		       5 --> 1
		       6 --> 2
		       7 --> 1

The minimum number of colors to properly color graph 2 is: 8
